The k-means clustering

The k-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that helps in
partitioning data of n observations into K buckets of similar observations.
The clustering algorithm is called so because it operates by computing the mean of
the features which refer to the dependent variables based on which we cluster things,
such as segmenting of customers based on an average transaction amount and the
average number of products purchased in a quarter of a year. This mean value
then becomes the center of a cluster. The number K refers to the number of clusters,
that is, the technique consisting of computing a K number of means, leading to the
clustering of the data around these k-means.
